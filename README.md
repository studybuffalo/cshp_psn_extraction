# CSHP PSN Extraction Tool
Tool to automate archiving of the CSHP PSN eForums

# Background
This tool is used to scrape all data and attachments from the CSHP 
eForum. Access to the eForum is/was required for this to program to 
work. This required connecting to the eForum and passing the login

downloading the content and any attachments. These files were then 
processed to either allow viewing in a web browser locally or were 
all converted into a single PDF.
